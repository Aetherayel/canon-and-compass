        What is growing in your life is trying to tell the truth.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 max-w-prose">
        Fruit Paths begin with what most people notice first - the anxiety that will not quiet, the
        exhaustion that lingers, the control that tightens, the hope that thins out.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 max-w-prose">
        These are not random flaws. They are fruit.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 max-w-prose">
        Fruit Paths exist to help you trace what is growing in your life back to its roots - and to
        re-root in truth that can actually sustain new growth.

      <p class="mt-3 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 max-w-prose">
        Each Fruit Path follows a single, honest movement:
      </p>
      <p class="mt-3 text-zinc-700 dark:text-zinc-300 font-semibold">
        Unwanted fruit -> hidden root -> healing truth -> renewed fruit
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 max-w-prose">
        Rather than jumping straight to solutions, a Fruit Path helps you:
      </p>
      <ul class="mt-4 grid gap-2 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 max-w-prose">
        <li>name what is showing up in your life</li>
        <li>understand why it once made sense</li>
        <li>uncover the lie beneath it</li>
        <li>encounter the truth that addresses that lie</li>
        <li>recognize the fruit you have been longing for - even if you never had words for it</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 max-w-prose">
        This is not behavior management. It is re-rooting.

        Each Fruit Path walks between two trees - on the same ground.

            But over time, it produces fruit that exhausts rather than nourishes.

            This tree grows from a biblical truth meant to be abided in, not applied.

            Its fruit does not arrive all at once - but it is steadier, deeper, and life-giving.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-2 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400">
            A Fruit Path does not ask you to jump from one tree to the other. It traces how roots are exchanged.

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black dark:text-white">Why We Start with Symptoms</h2>
      <p class="mt-3 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 max-w-prose">
        Most people do not begin by asking about beliefs or formation. They begin by feeling:
      </p>
      <ul class="mt-4 grid gap-2 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 max-w-prose">
        <li>tense</li>
        <li>tired</li>
        <li>reactive</li>
        <li>brittle</li>
        <li>overwhelmed</li>
        <li>or quietly numb</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4 text-zinc-600 dark:text-zinc-400 max-w-prose">
        Fruit Paths take those experiences seriously. They begin with what you feel - and honor it enough to ask where it came from.

        Each Fruit Path opens into Foundations - Scripture-anchored reflections, cultural discernment, and deeper
