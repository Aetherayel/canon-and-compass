Emotions are real — but they are not ultimate.  
They are signposts, not steering wheels. They tell us what matters to us, but they are not the measure of truth.  

Jesus felt deeply: grief at Lazarus’ tomb, joy in the Spirit, righteous anger in the temple. But He was never overrun. He lived Spirit-led, not emotion-led.

## Scripture Meditation

<Scripture refText="Galatians 5:22–23">
  “But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.”
</Scripture>

Read this slowly. Which word rises up in contrast to the emotion that most often carries you away? Hold it before God. Ask the Spirit: “Grow this fruit in me.”

## Practice

When emotion rises, pause for three breaths. Say:  
- **Breath 1:** “This is real.”  
- **Breath 2:** “This is not ultimate.”  
- **Breath 3:** “Spirit, guide me here.”

## Prayer

> **Lord, thank You for making me a feeling person.  
> Teach me to listen without being enslaved.  
> Let Your Spirit lead my responses.**
