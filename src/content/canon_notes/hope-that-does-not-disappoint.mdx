<Scripture refText="Romans 5:5">
“Hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts 
through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.”
</Scripture>

Cynicism feels safe: if you never expect much, you’ll never be disappointed.  
But Scripture says the opposite—hope in Christ never shames you, because it’s built on God’s love, not fragile outcomes.

## Reflection  
- Where have I quietly given up on God’s promises?  
- What would it look like to risk hope again, even in a small way?  

---

## Practice  
- **Write:** List one area where you’ve grown cynical. Beneath it, write a promise of God that speaks against it (Romans 8:28, Philippians 1:6, etc.).  
- **Pray:** Hand the cynicism back to God: *“You are faithful even where I doubt.”*  
- **Repeat:** Whisper during the day: *“My hope will not be put to shame.”*

## Prayer  
*Lord, uncover the places where I’ve buried hope under irony or disappointment. Teach me that Your promises are stronger than my fears. Give me courage to hope again in You.*
