You don’t earn oxygen; you breathe it.  
The same is true of rest in Christ. It isn’t payment for performance—it’s provision for presence.  

Our culture trains us to think of rest as something you must deserve, a reward given only after the work is complete. But Jesus interrupts that narrative: **rest is the starting point, not the finish line.** We begin from belovedness, not toward it.

## Practice

Take five slow breaths. With each exhale, whisper: *“It is finished.”*  
Let the words settle, not as a slogan but as reality. The cross has already secured your worth.

## Prayer

> **Lord, untangle my worth from my work. Teach me to abide in You.  
> Give me courage to rest as a child, not a servant.**
