Control clings; prayer releases.  
Every prayer is a small act of surrender, a declaration that God reigns and you do not.

## Scripture Meditation

<Scripture refText="Psalm 46:10">
  “Be still, and know that I am God.”
</Scripture>

Breathe slowly as you read. Where is God inviting you to stillness today?

## Practice

Hold your hands clenched into fists. Name one burden you carry. Slowly open your hands and pray: *“This belongs to You.”*

---

## Prayer

> **Lord, I release what I cannot hold.  
> You reign; I do not.  
> Teach me to trust Your sovereignty.**
