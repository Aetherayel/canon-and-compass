Gratitude is not denial of pain — it is remembrance of provision.  
Every thank-you is a protest against scarcity.  

Envy shrinks your world until you see only what you lack. Gratitude expands it again, reminding you that God has not forgotten you.

## Scripture Meditation

<Scripture refText="Philippians 4:11–12">
  “I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need.”
</Scripture>

Read this slowly. Circle the words *learned* and *secret.* Gratitude is not natural — it is cultivated. Where could you practice it today?

## Practice

Write down three ways God has provided in the last 24 hours — even if they are small (a meal, a smile, a breath).  
After each one, say out loud: *“This was enough.”*

## Prayer

> **Lord, turn my eyes from what I lack to what You have given.  
> Teach me to remember Your abundance.**
