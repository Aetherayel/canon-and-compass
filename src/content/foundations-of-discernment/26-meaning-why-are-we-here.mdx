### Opening Story

A grief counselor works with families who have lost loved ones. Over and over, she notices that those who anchor their hope in temporal pleasures struggle to find peace, while those who trust in God’s greater purposes discover a deep, unshakeable resilience. True meaning flows not from circumstance but from participating in God’s redemptive work.

### Devotional Reflection

1. **Philosophical Insight:**
    
    - Existentialist thinkers like Sartre warned of “absurdity”—life without intrinsic meaning leads to despair. Humanistic pursuits offer fleeting satisfaction. Only a transcendent purpose, rooted in a Creator—Redeemer, gives enduring significance.
    
2. **Theological Anchor:**
    
    - God created us for relationship and worship (John 17:3). Jesus invites us into His mission—to “seek first the kingdom” (Matthew 6:33)—so that every task, joy, and trial aligns with our higher calling to reflect His glory.
    
3. **Practical Implication:**
    
    - In your daily routines—work, family, service—ask: “How does this moment allow me to glorify God and love others?” Viewing life as sacred vocation transforms even mundane tasks into acts of worship.
    

> Socratic Prompt:

> “Which pursuits leave you empty, and how might aligning with God’s mission bring lasting fulfillment?”
