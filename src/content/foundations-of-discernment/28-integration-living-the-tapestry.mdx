### Today’s Word

<Scripture refText="Ephesians 1:22–23 (ESV)">
And [God] has put all things under [Christ’s] feet and gave him as head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.
</Scripture>

### Opening Story

A concertmaster tunes the orchestra before the final performance. Each musician has practiced their part in isolation—strings, woodwinds, brass, percussion—but only when they play together under a single score does the symphony come alive. Today, we take every principle, every insight, every practiced exercise from the past four weeks and join them into one living performance of worship, wisdom, and witness.

### Devotional Reflection

1. **From Tools to Tapestry:**
    
    - You’ve learned to bow in awe, reason from first principles, trust God’s Word, wrestle with reality, engage every spirit, and frame every question—Origin, Truth, Morality, Meaning, Destiny—within Christ’s narrative.
    
2. **Embodied Coherence:**
    
    - Discernment isn’t a checklist but a rhythm: **Pause + Pray + Probe + Apply + Rest + Repeat.** When each day flows from that pattern, your life becomes a seamless expression of God’s glory.
    
3. **Missional Outflow:**
    
    - A woven tapestry isn’t meant to stay on the loom. As the church, we live out this integrated worldview in our families, workplaces, and communities—bringing clarity to confusion, hope to despair, and love to every conversation.
    

> Socratic Prompt:

> “What one principle or practice from these four weeks will you commit to carry forward daily? How can you remind yourself to engage it?”

### Wordsmith Corner

- **Embodied Discernment:** The seamless outworking of belief into every thought, word, and deed—so that worldview and action are indistinguishable.

### In Today’s World

- Fragmentation plagues our culture: we adopt a bit of this ideology here, a bit of that trend there. But the church is called to **integrated witness**, manifesting the unity of Christ in a divided world.

### Counterfeit Versions

| **Shadow Approach** | **True Integration** |
| --- | --- |
| **Checklist Christianity:** Treating faith as a series of tasks to check off rather than a living, relational response to God. | **Rhythmic Living:** Discernment as daily posture, not periodic task. |
| **Compartmentalized Faith:** Keeping spiritual beliefs separated from “ordinary” life areas (work, relationships, politics, etc.). | **Holistic Faith:**
