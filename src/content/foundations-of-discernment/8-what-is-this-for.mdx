### **Opening Story**

A conservator in a library discovers a tattered manuscript whose pages are scattered and torn. Instead of throwing them away, she painstakingly gathers each fragment, discerning the author’s original intent through marginal notes and style. Only when the text is restored to its coherent whole does its message—and beauty—truly emerge.

In the same way, **telos thinking** invites us to view people, choices, and circumstances not as isolated facts but as fragments pointing toward a grand, divine narrative.

### **Devotional Reflection**

1. **Philosophical Insight**
    - For Aristotle, the *telos* of a thing is its end or purpose. An acorn’s telos is to be an oak; humanity’s telos is to flourish according to its design. Stripping away distractions, we ask: “What is this for?”
2. **Theological Anchoring**
    - Scripture teaches that God works “all things according to the counsel of his will” (Ephesians 1:11). From the tiniest neuron to the greatest nation, every element of creation moves toward His glorious ends—chief among them, displaying His wisdom and love.
3. **Practical Application**
    - When faced with a decision, habit, or hardship, practice asking, “What end has God designed here?” This shifts perspective from “Why is this happening to me?” to “How might God be shaping me or revealing Himself through this?”

**Socratic Prompt:**

“Where have I treated experiences as random rather than purposeful? How would life change if I lived each moment asking, ‘What is God’s intended end here?’”

### **Wordsmith Corner**

- **Telos:** Greek for “end,” “purpose,” or “goal.” It points beyond the present toward the fulfilled design of a thing.

---

### **In Today�?Ts World**

- **Purposelessness Epidemic:** Many drift through life in search of meaning. Careers, relationships, even technology become ends in themselves. Telos-driven thinking reorients us to the ultimate End—the worship and likeness of Christ.

### **Counterfeit Versions**

| **Shadow Perspective** | **True Telos Awareness** |
| --- | --- |
| **Means-Ends Reversal:** Using people or gifts to achieve personal agenda. | **God-Centered Ends:** Letting God’s glory shape every aim. |
| **Aimless Drift:** Floating along without goals. | **Deliberate Direction:** Pursuing the divine purpose behind each step. |
| **Self-Definition:** Defining worth by achievements. | **Divine Identity:** Finding worth in being God’s image-bearer. |

---

### **Prayer Prompt**

“Father of Purpose, forgive me for treating life as a series of accidents or self-made goals. Open my eyes to Your grand design in every detail. Teach me to ask, ‘What are You accomplishing?’ and to trust Your wisdom in the journey. May my heart beat in rhythm with Your eternal telos. In Jesus’ name, Amen.”

### **Spiritual Exercise**

1. **End-Oriented Journaling**
    - Select one mundane routine (morning commute, dishwashing, work emails). Pause and ask, “To what end did God design this?” Write your insights and a brief prayer of offering that task back to Him.
2. **Telos Test in Decision-Making**
    - For a current choice—big or small—map out the potential “ends” (desires, outcomes). Against each, ask: “Does this align with God’s purposes of glory, love, and holiness?” Let that guide you.

### **For Deeper Digging**

- **Group Discussion:**
    1. How might a telos perspective reshape our church’s mission or your personal calling?
    2. In what areas have you pursued goals misaligned with God’s intended ends?
