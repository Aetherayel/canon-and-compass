I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
</Scripture>

### **Opening Story**

A seasoned warrior returns from many campaigns. His armor bears dents, his sword shows nicks—but his eyes are calm. He lays aside his weapon, gathers with fellow soldiers, and shares stories of narrowly averted ambushes and hard-won ground. In rest, he processes the cost and celebrates the grace that carried him through. Our spiritual battles require similar pause: to remember, to heal, and to ready ourselves for the road ahead.

### **Devotional Reflection**

1. **Reviewing the Battle**
    - This week we’ve engaged in discernment—wrestling falsehoods, refining our character, and answering lies. Like Paul’s “fight,” our discernment battles aren’t against people but against error, apathy, and self-deception.
2. **Finding Rest in Victory**
    - Victory in Christ is assured; our calling is to “stand firm” (Ephesians 6:14) and then “enter His rest” (Hebrews 4:11). Sabbath rest isn’t escape from duty but the completion of it in God’s presence.
3. **Refocusing for the Next Fight**
    - Rest sharpens spiritual senses. As Psalm 23’s shepherd leads beside still waters, He prepares us for paths of righteousness. Our sabbath reflection equips us for the next season of discernment and service.

> Socratic Prompt:

> 
> “How has God’s grace sustained me in this marathon of discernment? What lessons from these past days fuel my confidence as I step into new challenges?”

### **Wordsmith Corner**

- **Fight the Good Fight:** A metaphor for persevering in faith and truth despite opposition.
- **Enter His Rest:** Transitioning from striving in our strength to abiding in God’s sufficiency.
