### Today’s Word

<Scripture refText="Revelation 21:4 (ESV)">
He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more… for the former things have passed away.
</Scripture>

### Opening Story

At the end of a long novel, the final chapter reveals how every hardship, every loss, and every twist in the plot served a larger purpose. The scattered threads resolve into a breathtaking conclusion—one that reframes the entire journey. In the same way, **God’s promised future** gives meaning to every moment of our lives now. The end of the story is not the grave, but glory.

### Devotional Reflection

1. **Philosophical Foundation:**
    
    - Secular worldviews often land in **fatalism**, **reincarnation**, or **oblivion**. But only the biblical worldview promises a *resurrection*—a healed creation where justice, joy, and worship endure. Destiny isn’t escape; it’s renewal.
    
2. **Theological Anchor:**
    
    - The gospel doesn’t stop at forgiveness; it promises consummation. Christ will return, evil will be judged, creation will be made new, and God will dwell with His people (Revelation 21:1–5). Our eternal future is embodied, communal, and radiant with glory.
    
3. **Practical Implication:**
    
    - What we believe about the future shapes how we live in the present. If the end is renewal, not destruction, then every act of beauty, love, truth, and justice now becomes a *foretaste* of God’s kingdom. Hope fuels endurance.
    

> Socratic Prompt:
> 
> 
> “If my future is guaranteed in Christ, how should that reshape my fears, ambitions, and the way I spend my time today?”

### Wordsmith Corner

- **Consummation:** The final act of God’s redemptive plan where all things are made new and every purpose fulfilled.
- **Eschatology:** The study of ‘last things’—heaven, judgment, resurrection, and the new creation.

### In Today’s World

- Many chase immortality through fame, tech, or legacy—but still fear death’s finality. Others numb themselves with distraction, pretending the end will never come. Yet only the Christian hope offers *both realism and joy*: death is real, but it doesn’t have the last word.
