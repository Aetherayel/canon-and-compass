### ***Every Person Bears Divine Reflection***

---

**What to Remember Today:**

*You carry God�?Ts fingerprint—honor yourself and others accordingly.*

---

### **Today�?Ts Word**

<Scripture refText="Genesis 1:27 (ESV)">
So God created man in his own image,<br />
in the image of God he created him;<br />
male and female he created them.
</Scripture>

### **Opening Story**

A master sculptor was commissioned to carve a statue of a beloved queen. Day after day, he chipped away stone, watching as the marble took shape. When visitors marveled, he would smile and say, “I did not create her likeness; I only revealed what was already there.”

Like that statue, every human being bears the **Imago Dei**—not something we earn or achieve, but something we reflect by virtue of our creation. Our dignity, creativity, and moral capacity flow from that divine imprint.

### **Devotional Reflection**

1. **Philosophical Grounding**
    - Across cultures, the worth of a person has often been tied to status, productivity, or ability. Yet the concept of **intrinsic value** insists that dignity is unconditional. Imago Dei is the ultimate foundation for that value.
2. **Theological Reality**
    - In crafting humanity “in his own image,” God endowed us with relationality (Trinity echo), creativity (God as Creator), and moral conscience (God as Lawgiver). We weren’t an afterthought but the climactic verse in creation’s song.
3. **Practical Weight**
    - If every person bears God’s image, then injustice, prejudice, and dehumanization aren’t tactical errors—they are sacrilegious offenses against the Creator Himself.

**Socratic Prompt:**

“How would my relationships, work, and social views change if I treated every person as an icon of God’s presence?”

---

### **Wordsmith Corner**

- **Imago Dei:** Latin for “Image of God.” It denotes not physical resemblance but shared capacities: reason, will, creativity, and relationship.

---

### **In Today�?Ts World**

- **Debates on Personhood:** From bioethics to AI, the question “What is a human?” shapes policy and culture. Upholding Imago Dei provides an unshakable anchor amid shifting definitions.

### **Counterfeit Versions**

| Shadow View | True Imago Dei Perspective |
| --- | --- |
| **Utilitarianism:** People valued only for utility. | **Inherent Dignity:** People valued simply by being. |
| **Objectification:** Treating humans as means to ends. | **Relationality:** Embracing community and mutual worth. |
| **Self-Worship:** Elevating self-image above all. | **Godward Worship:** Reflecting God’s glory back to Him. |

---

### **Prayer Prompt**

“Creator God, thank You for crafting me in Your image. Forgive me for times I’ve treated people—or myself—as instruments rather than icons. Help me see beyond surface and ability, and honor every person as bearing Your presence. Teach me to reflect Your glory in thought, word, and deed. In Jesus’ name, Amen.”

---

### **Spiritual Exercise**

1. **See the Image**
    - Today, look each person you meet—coworker, barista, neighbor—and silently pray, “You are God’s masterpiece.” Notice any changes in your posture or tone.
2. **Creative Offering**
    - Use your gifts—writing, drawing, cooking, problem-solving—to bless someone without expectation. Journal how engaging your creativity helped you reflect God’s image.

---

### **For Deeper Digging**

- **Group Discussion:**
    1. When have you felt most “seen” as God’s image-bearer?
    2. How can your community tangibly honor each other’s dignity this week?
