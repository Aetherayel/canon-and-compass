### Today’s Word

<Scripture refText="John 17:17 (ESV)">
Sanctify them in the truth; your word is truth.
</Scripture>

### Opening Story

A reporter in a crisis zone sifts through rumors, conflicting eyewitness accounts, and propaganda. Frustrated, she returns to the unedited transcripts of official statements and off-the-record interviews. By anchoring every fact to those primary sources, she uncovers what really happened. In a world awash with spin and conjecture, **truth emerges when we lean on the Authoritative Voice**.

### Devotional Reflection

1. **Philosophical Grounding:**
    
    - Epistemology asks, “How do we know what we know?” Secular reason often ends in skepticism or relativism, where “truth” is whatever feels right. But without an eternal, unchanging standard, every claim becomes provisional.
    
2. **Theological Foundation:**
    
    - Jesus prayed that His followers be sanctified in the truth of God’s Word. Christ Himself is the Logos (John 1:1)—the thought and intent of God incarnate. Scripture and the Person of Jesus together anchor every fact and belief.
    
3. **Life Application:**
    
    - When you hear a new teaching, political slogan, or cultural catchphrase—test it against Scripture. Does it align with God’s revealed character and commands? A biblical worldview trusts divine revelation over human consensus.
    

> Socratic Prompt:

> “Which beliefs in your life rest on personal opinion rather than on God’s Word? What would change if you rooted them in Scripture?”

### Wordsmith Corner

- **Epistemology:** The study of knowledge—its scope, limits, and sources.
- **Logos:** Greek for “Word” or “Reason,” used in John 1 to describe Christ as God’s self-expression.

### In Today’s World

- In our “post-truth” age, social media bubbles and opinion polls often declare what’s “true.” But consensus cannot create reality. Only God’s unchanging Word provides a reliable lens through which to discern fact from falsehood.

### Counterfeit Versions

| **Shadow Perspective** | **Biblical Worldview Response** |

| **Relativism:** Truth is what you feel or what your group agrees on. | **Objective Revelation:** God’s Word is the unchanging standard, not shifting human opinion. |
| **Skeptical Nihilism:**
