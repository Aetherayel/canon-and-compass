### Today’s Word

<Scripture refText="Romans 2:14–15 (ESV)">
For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves… since what the law requires is written on their hearts.
</Scripture>

### Opening Story

In a small town, neighbors banded together to care for an elderly widow. No law compelled them; they acted simply because compassion felt right. Later, they discovered the widow had quietly ministered to many in her youth. Her life had inscribed kindness into their hearts—an echo of God’s moral design evident even without explicit rules.

### Devotional Reflection

1. **Philosophical Foundation:**
    
    - Moral relativism argues that ethics are human constructs. But if every culture invents its own “good,” we lose any anchor for condemning atrocities. Natural Law theory affirms that right and wrong are discoverable by reason because they’re imprinted by a moral Creator.
    
2. **Theological Anchor:**
    
    - God is both Lawgiver and Judge. His commands aren’t arbitrary; they flow from His holy character. Jesus summarized them in love for God and neighbor (Matthew 22:37–40), showing morality is relational, not merely ritual.
    
3. **Practical Implication:**
    
    - When you face an ethical choice—honesty in business, fairness in relationships, care for the marginalized—ask: “What would love and justice demand here?” Your conscience, shaped by Scripture and the Spirit, will often guide you toward God’s design.
    

> Socratic Prompt:

> “Which moral convictions do you share with non-Christians, and how do they reflect the law written on every heart?”

### Wordsmith Corner

- **Natural Law:** The set of moral principles inherent in creation, readable by human reason and consonant with God’s revealed will.

### In Today’s World

- In an age where “tolerance” can mean “anything goes,” pointing to a transcendent moral standard can feel countercultural. Yet conviction without compassion risks judgmentalism. A biblical ethic combines absolute truth with Christlike mercy.

| **Situational Ethics:** Right and wrong depend on context alone. | **God’s Unchanging Character:** His commands apply universally, though wisdom shapes application. |
| **Cultural Constructivism:** Morality is whatever society agrees upon. | **Objective Order:**
