## ***Walking Between Promise and Fulfillment***

**What to Remember Today:**

*We live in the tension of Christ�?Ts inaugurated kingdom—celebrating what is ours today while longing for its full consummation.*

---

### **Today�?Ts Word**

<Scripture refText="Romans 8:24–25 (ESV)">
In this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.
</Scripture>

### **Opening Story**

A gardener plants tender seedlings in early spring. Each day she waters and protects them, but winter’s chill lingers. She knows the harvest is certain—she’s seen the seed break ground before—but the fruit is not yet. In this “already/not yet” season, she labors with expectation, trusting the unseen growth beneath the soil.

Similarly, believers dwell in the kingdom inaugurated by Christ’s life, death, and resurrection—already victorious—yet awaiting the fullness of that victory at His return.

### **Devotional Reflection**

1. **Philosophical Insight**
    - Many philosophies seek either total immersion in the present or escape into utopian visions. The “already/not yet” worldview holds both: reality is redeemed but remains groaning (Romans 8:22).
2. **Theological Anchor**
    - Jesus proclaimed, “The kingdom of God is among you” (Luke 17:21)—it’s here in signs and wonders—yet He promised, “I will come again” (John 14:3). We live between the two advents, called to embody kingdom life now, even as we yearn for its completion.
3. **Daily Implications**
    - **Hope without Passivity:** We engage culture and care for creation because our future vindication empowers present action.
    - **Joy amid Sorrow:** We mourn brokenness, yet we celebrate that the final healing is certain.

**Socratic Prompt:**

“In what areas of life am I living as though the kingdom is only future—or only present? How would embracing both dimensions change my posture toward today’s challenges?”

### **Wordsmith Corner**

- **Inaugurated Eschatology:** The doctrine that Christ’s first coming begins the end-times kingdom, while its consummation awaits His return.
- **Consummation:** The final fulfillment of God’s redemptive plan.

---

### **In Today�?Ts World**

- **Instant Gratification vs. Disillusionment:** We expect quick fixes and become cynical when they fail. The already/not yet reality calls us to patient endurance, sustained by the assurance of Christ’s ultimate victory.

### **Counterfeit Versions**

| **Shadow View** | **True “Already/Not Yet” Posture** |
| --- | --- |
| **Triumphalism:** Acting as if the world is fully redeemed. | **Patient Witness:** Working faithfully without illusion. |
| **Escapism:** Ignoring present suffering for future glory. | **Engaged Hope:** Addressing pain now, fueled by hope. |
| **Cultural Conformity:** Blending in without offering hope. | **Kingdom Distinctiveness:** Living visibly countercultural in love. |

---

### **Prayer Prompt**

“Lord Jesus, You have broken into history and yet are coming again. Forgive me for acting as if Your kingdom is only future—or only present. Give me eyes to see Your reign today and a heart that perseveres in hope. Empower me to be Your witness now, pointing others to the fullness of joy that awaits. In Your name, Amen.”

### **Spiritual Exercise**

1. **Kingdom Audit**
    - List three ways you see God’s kingdom at work around you (in your church, neighborhood, world).
    - Then list three areas still awaiting redemption. Pray through both lists—thanksgiving for what is “already” and intercession for what is “not yet.”
2. **Hope-Fueled Action**
    - Choose one “not yet” issue (e.g., injustice, loneliness, environmental decay) and take one concrete step this week—serve, donate, advocate—motivated by the promise of God’s ultimate restoration. Journal how your hope sustains that action.

---

### **For Deeper Digging**

- **Group Discussion:**
    1. How can your community practice rhythms that remind you of both the inaugurated kingdom (worship, service) and the future hope (anticipatory symbols, prayers of longing)?
    2. What helps you sustain faith in the “not yet” during seasons of discouragement?
