## ***Knowing How Little We Know***

---

**What to Remember Today:**

*True wisdom flourishes in the tension between what we know and what we must trust God to reveal.*

---

### **Today�?Ts Word**

<Scripture refText="Romans 11:33 (ESV)">
Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!
</Scripture>

### **Opening Story**

An astronomer peers through a powerful telescope, marveling at distant galaxies. She catalogs stars by the thousands, yet with each discovery, she senses the vastness of the unknown growing. In that paradox—vast knowledge and unfathomable mystery—she bows, acknowledging both her expertise and her limits.

Likewise, **epistemic humility** invites us to hold our convictions with courage and our uncertainties with reverence, trusting that God’s wisdom transcends even our most rigorous inquiry.

### **Devotional Reflection**

1. **The Philosophical Posture**
    - Epistemic humility is the recognition that our beliefs, however well-founded, are fallible. It refuses the arrogance of claiming full mastery over truth.
2. **Biblical Grounding**
    - Scripture models this balance. Job sat in ashes, lamenting his incomprehension (Job 42:3), yet Paul asserts confidence in divine revelation (Ephesians 1:17–18). We follow both precedents: bold in what God has shown, humble before the rest.
3. **Practicing the Tension**
    - Stand firm on revealed truths—God’s character, Christ’s work, Scripture’s authority—while cultivating a posture of prayerful openness to new insights. This keeps us both grounded and teachable.

**Socratic Prompt:**

“Which of my convictions have I held too tightly? Where might I need to ‘unclench my fist’ and allow God to reshape my understanding?”

### **Wordsmith Corner**

- **Epistemic Humility:** A virtue in epistemology acknowledging the limits of one’s knowledge and being open to correction.

---

### **In Today�?Ts World**

- **Echo Chambers:** Social media and partisan media often reward certainty and punish doubt. Yet the Christian journey values truth over tribal applause, embracing questions as doors to deeper faith.

### **Counterfeit Versions**

| Shadow Posture | Epistemic Humility |
| --- | --- |
| **Relativistic Doubt:** Rejecting all knowledge as uncertain. | **Anchored Wonder:** Trusting God’s revealed truth amid mystery. |
| **Dogmatic Certainty:** Refusing any correction or nuance. | **Teachable Confidence:** Holding beliefs courageously yet revisably. |
| **Intellectual Elitism:** Using knowledge to elevate self. | **Servant Inquiry:** Seeking truth to serve others and glorify God. |

---

### **Prayer Prompt**

“God of infinite wisdom, forgive my arrogance in presuming to know too much and my despair in believing I know too little. Grant me a humble heart—steadfast in Your revelation and open to Your ongoing instruction. In Jesus’ name, Amen.”

---

### **Spiritual Exercise**

1. **Teach & Learn**
    - Share one of your core convictions with a friend or mentor and invite their honest feedback. Listen without defending; ask where you might be mistaken.
2. **Mystery Meditation**
    - Choose a difficult passage in Scripture. Read it slowly, then sit in silent prayer, acknowledging both what you understand and what remains hidden. Journal any fresh admiration for God’s unsearchable ways.

---

### **For Deeper Digging**

- **Group Discussion:**
    1. How can we cultivate a church culture that values questions as much as answers?
    2. In what areas of life do you sense God calling you to more humility before mystery?
