### **Today’s Word**

<Scripture refText="1 Thessalonians 5:21 (ESV)">
Test all things; hold fast what is good.
</Scripture>

### **Opening Story**

Picture the prophet Daniel in Babylon’s court. Surrounded by palaces and pagan feasts, he faced a simple menu question—what to eat. Yet in that choice lay his faith’s future. By refusing the king’s delicacies and negotiating a ten-day test (Daniel 1:8–14), Daniel won God’s favor and gained insight that shaped nations. His story shows that even small decisions, rooted in discernment, can have world-shaping consequences.

### **Devotional Reflection**

1. **Case Study: Daniel’s Dietary Stand**
    - **Contextual Wisdom:** Daniel recognized that food wasn’t neutral—it carried idolatrous symbolism.
    - **Courageous Negotiation:** He didn’t rebel but respectfully proposed an alternative.
    - **Result:** God honored his faithfulness, and Daniel’s clarity set him apart as “ten times better” than peers.
2. **Case Study: Paul and the Trojan Horse**
    - **Contextual Discernment:** In Acts 27, Paul warns the centurion not to sail on Crete’s dangerous lee shores.
    - **Spirit-Led Authority:** He spoke with the confidence of one who heard the Lord’s vision.
    - **Outcome:** Though the ship wrecked, all lives were spared—a testament to discerning word in crisis.
3. **Lessons for Us**
    - **Context Matters:** Discernment listens to culture, Scripture, and the Spirit simultaneously.
    - **Speak with Humility and Authority:** Discernment isn’t arrogance—it’s submission to God’s leading.
    - **Small Choices, Big Impact:** Everyday decisions can open doors for God’s glory or shut them.

> Socratic Prompt:
> 
> 
> “Which everyday choice feels ‘too small’ to matter? How might God use your faithful discernment in that sphere to influence others?”
>

### **Wordsmith Corner**

- **Discernment (diakrisis):** The ability to distinguish between truth and error, good and evil, God’s will and personal preference.

---

### **In Today’s World**

- **Information Overload vs. Scriptural Focus:** We’re bombarded with opinions. Like Daniel, we must filter choices through the lens of Scripture and prayer, refusing what contradicts God’s revealed character.

### **Counterfeit Versions**

| **Shadow Discernment** | **True Discernment** |
| --- | --- |
| **Paralysis by Analysis:**
Endless weighing without action. | **Decisive Obedience:**
Calculated steps grounded in prayer. |
| **Opinion Conformity:**
Adopting majority views for safety. | **Spirit-Led Distinctiveness:**
Standing firm on God’s voice, even alone. |
| **Spiritual Shortcutting:**
Jumping to conclusions without verification. | **Thorough Testing:**
Testing through Scripture, counsel, and prayer. |

### **Prayer Prompt**

> “Sovereign Lord, grant me eyes to see when choices—even small ones—carry weight. Give me the wisdom of Daniel, the courage of Paul, and the humility to test every impulse by Your Word. May my discernment serve Your purposes and bring You glory. In Jesus’ name, Amen.”
>

### **Spiritual Exercise**

1. **Case Study Journaling**
    - Choose a recent decision—big or small. Map its context, your options, and the factors you considered (Scripture, counsel, circumstances). Reflect on what went well and what you’d do differently next time.
2. **Discernment Drill**
    - With a friend or accountability partner, role-play a simple scenario (e.g., responding to an offensive comment online). Practice pausing, praying, and responding with both truth and grace.

### **For Deeper Digging**

- **Group Discussion:**
    1. Which biblical model of discernment inspires you most, and why?
    2. How can your group create regular “case study” sessions to sharpen one another’s discernment?
