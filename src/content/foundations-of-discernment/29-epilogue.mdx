### Closing Reflection

You began this journey 28 days ago, threading together principles of reverent awe, rigorous reason, humble inquiry, and steadfast hope. Today, you stand at the loom’s edge—tapestry in hand—equipped not simply with knowledge, but with practices that shape your heart, mind, and actions.

As you step away from these pages:

- **Continue the Rhythm:** Keep pausing in worship, probing with Scripture, and resting in God’s grace.
- **Share the Story:** Invite others into this journey—mentor a friend, lead a small group, or journal your discoveries online.
- **Stay Teachable:** New questions will arise; treat them as fresh threads to weave into your understanding.

This devotional is both a foundation and a launchpad. May each tool you’ve learned become second nature—a lens through which you view every conversation, every decision, and every moment of your life.

### Benediction Prayer

> “Gracious Father, thank You for guiding me through these days of discovery. As I move forward, let Your Spirit anchor my soul in the truths I’ve learned. May I walk in discernment, speak in love, and live in the fullness of Your unfolding story. Bless this tapestry of my life, that it might display Your glory to all I meet. In Jesus’ name, Amen.”
