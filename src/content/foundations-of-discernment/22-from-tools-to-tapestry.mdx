### Today’s Word

<Scripture refText="Isaiah 46:9 (ESV)">
Remember the former things of old; for I am God, and there is none else, and there is none like me.
</Scripture>

### Opening Story

A master weaver threads dozens of colorful strands—gold, crimson, sapphire—into a single tapestry. Each individual thread is beautiful, but only when interlaced do the hidden images emerge: scenes of victory, mercy, and homecoming. This week, we take the “threads” of wisdom tools—reverence, reason, coherence, and rest—and reveal how they unite into a comprehensive **biblical worldview**.

---

### Devotional Reflection

Over three weeks you have:

1. **Bowed in Awe** (Week 1) — cultivating reverence as the bedrock of wisdom.
2. **Wrestled with Reality** (Week 2) — testing assumptions, tracing purposes, and discerning spiritual patterns.
3. **Tested Every Spirit** (Week 3) — engaging lies with grace, discerning truth in action, and resting in victory.

Now the question emerges: **Why does any of it matter?** Because behind every tool lies a deeper question of:

- **Origin:** Where did we come from?
- **Truth:** How do we know what is real?
- **Morality:** What is right and wrong?
- **Meaning:** Why are we here?
- **Destiny:** Where are we going?

This week, we’ll see that **only the biblical story**—God as Creator, Word, Judge, Redeemer, and King—provides satisfying, unified answers to all five.

### Wordsmith Corner

- **Worldview:** A framework of beliefs about origin, reality, morality, purpose, and destiny through which we interpret every experience.

---

### In Today’s World

- Many settle for **fragmented philosophies**: one system for science, another for ethics, a third for purpose. Yet such patchwork yields confusion and anxiety. A truly **integrated worldview** offers coherence for the mind and peace for the soul.

### Counterfeit Versions

| Shadow Perspective | Biblical Worldview Response |
| --- | --- |
| **Relativism**: Truth changes with culture or opinion. | **Absolute Grounding:** Only God’s character and Word provide unchanging truth. |
| **Nihilism**: Life has no inherent purpose or value. | **Hope-Filled Purpose:** We are created on mission, not as cosmic accidents. |
| **Compartmentalized Faith:** Keeping faith isolated from daily life spheres. | **Unified Story:** Creation—Fall—Redemption—Consummation shapes every sphere. |

### Prayer Prompt

> “Sovereign Storyteller, I praise You for weaving my life into Your eternal narrative. Open my eyes to see every question—Of where I come from, what I know, how I live, why I exist, and where I’m headed—as threads in Your grand design. Teach me to live in the assurance of Your Story.”

### Spiritual Exercise

1. **Tapestry Sketch:** On a blank page, draw five lines converging at a center point labeled “God.” Label each line: Origin, Truth, Morality, Meaning, Destiny. Spend a few minutes journaling one insight under each thread.
2. **Narrative Journal:** Write a short paragraph describing your own “story arc” in light of God’s Creation—Fall—Redemption—Consummation narrative.

### Visual Aid: “Threads of the Grand Narrative”

```
             Origin +  
                       \
                        [God: Creator—Redeemer—King]
                       /
          Truth +     

Morality +          → Meaning

             Destiny +  
```
