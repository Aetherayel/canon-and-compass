At the root of envy lies a distorted theology. It imagines a God who rations blessing like bread in famine.  
If someone else is favored, I must be forgotten. If they flourish, I must diminish.  

This is not merely a psychological problem. It is a vision of God too small to be trusted.

## A Brief History of Scarcity

The envy–scarcity connection is as old as humanity, but it has been reinforced by cultural narratives across time:

- **In the ancient world**, gods were believed to compete. To gain favor from one meant risking jealousy from another. Blessing was unstable, precarious.  
- **In medieval hierarchies**, status and resources were zero-sum. Nobility thrived only because peasants did not. Envy flourished where opportunity was locked behind birthright.  
- **In modern economics**, competition became creed: markets thrive on scarcity, demand is manipulated, and success is measured by outpacing rivals.  
- **In the digital age**, algorithms amplify comparison. Social media trains us daily in scarcity: your worth shrinks or swells with every like, follow, or highlight reel.  

Scarcity is not only an ancient whisper — it is a modern discipline. We are catechized into it.

## Envy in the Story of Scripture

Envy is one of the first human sins named after the Fall.  
- Cain envies Abel’s offering and kills him (Genesis 4).  
- Joseph’s brothers sell him into slavery out of jealousy (Genesis 37).  
- Saul resents David’s songs of praise and descends into paranoia (1 Samuel 18).  

James sums it bluntly:  
> *“Where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice.”* (James 3:16)  

Envy always breeds violence, disorder, and decay. It corrodes relationships because it assumes blessing is limited.

## The Abundance of God

Against this backdrop, the gospel is astonishing.  
God is not a rationer. He is the Creator who speaks worlds into being and calls them “very good.”  

Jesus reveals a Father of **overflowing abundance**:  
- Water to wine — gallons beyond what the wedding required (John 2).  
- Loaves and fish multiplied — with baskets left over (Mark 6).  
- Living water promised — not trickling, but springing up (John 4).  
- The Spirit poured out — not in measure, but without limit (John 3:34).  

In Christ, blessing is not diminished by distribution. Grace multiplies. Love expands. Mercy renews daily.

## Gratitude as Resistance

Gratitude, then, is not shallow optimism. It is **theological rebellion** against the lie of scarcity.  

To give thanks is to declare:  
- God is not holding out on me.  
- Their blessing is not my loss.  
- I have enough, because He is enough.  

Each act of gratitude breaks envy’s hold. It reframes life not as competition, but as communion.

## Why This Matters

Scarcity makes us competitors.  
Abundance makes us family.  

When identity is rooted in scarcity, others’ joy is a threat.  
When identity is rooted in Christ’s abundance, others’ joy becomes your joy. Their flourishing no longer subtracts from you; it multiplies grace.  

This is the logic of the kingdom:  
> *“The eye is the lamp of the body. If your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light.”* (Matthew 6:22)  

A generous eye sees abundance. A jealous eye sees lack. One leads to life; the other corrodes it.

## Reflection

- Where do I instinctively believe God’s goodness is scarce?  
- Whose blessing do I experience as my diminishment?  
- What practice of gratitude could re-train my vision this week?
