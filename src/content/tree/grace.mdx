# The True Tree: **Grace-Based Identity**

**Burnout told you that worth is earned.**  
Grace tells you that worth is given.

<Scripture refText="Matthew 11:28–30">
  “Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 
  Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, 
  and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”
</Scripture>

    "branches": ["Sabbath", "Trust", "Identity in Christ"],

## New Fruit
| Old Fruit (what you’ve known) | New Fruit (what grows here) |
|---|---|
| **Burnout** — endless striving, exhaustion | **Peace** — knowing you are held even when you stop |
| **Anxiety** — fear of falling behind | **Trust** — believing God holds the timeline |
| **Shame** — “I should be more” | **Rest** — permission to be loved as you are |
| **Bitterness** — resenting others’ ease | **Joy** — delight in God’s gifts, without comparison |

## Next Steps

- **Breathe:** Try five deep breaths, each ending with the phrase: *“It is finished.”*  
- **Name a burden:** Write down one weight you’ve been carrying to prove yourself. Pray: *“Lord, this is Yours.”*  
- **Practice rest:** Choose one small act of Sabbath this week—not as a reward, but as worship.
