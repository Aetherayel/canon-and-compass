# The True Tree: **Spirit Led Identity**

**Emotions are real, but they aren’t ultimate.**  
They are signals, not definitions. The Spirit leads us to name them, but not be ruled by them

<Scripture refText="Galatians 5:22–23">
“But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.”
</Scripture>

## New Fruit
| Old Fruit (what you’ve known) | New Fruit (what grows here) |
|---|---|
**Outbursts** — reactions that fracture trust	| **Peace** — a calm rootedness that steadies responses
**Withdrawal** — pulling away in fear or shame	| **Connection** — choosing presence even when it feels risky
**Impulsivity** — acting before discernment	| **Patience** — giving space for wisdom to guide action
**Shame** — being ruled by regret and self-contempt	| **Freedom** — living from grace instead of guilt

## Next Steps

- **Pause + Pray:** When strong emotion rises, take 3 breaths and pray, *“Holy Spirit, lead me here.”*  
- **Name without enthroning:** Journal your feeling as data, not as definition.  
- **Choose one Spirit-fruit:** Ask, *“What would patience/peace/love look like here?”*
