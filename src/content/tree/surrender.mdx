# The True Tree: Surrender-Based Identity

Surrender is not giving up — it is handing over. It is living as though God’s sovereignty is real, not just recited.  

<Scripture refText="Proverbs 3:5–6">
  “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. 
  In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.”
</Scripture>
