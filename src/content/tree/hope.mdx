# The True Tree: **Hope-Based Identity**

**Cynicism told you hope is dangerous.**  
Hope in Christ tells you it is certain, because it rests not on circumstances but on His promises.  

<Scripture refText="Romans 5:5">
“Hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts 
through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.”
</Scripture>

## Next Steps
