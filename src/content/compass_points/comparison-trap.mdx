We live in a comparison economy.  
Social media thrives on it: highlight reels stacked against your ordinary days, follower counts as social proof, likes as instant verdicts.  

The system works because it feeds a deeper lie: *“There isn’t enough goodness to go around. If they win, you lose.”*

## How Culture Trains Envy

- **Infinite scroll = infinite measuring.** Every swipe offers another chance to fall short.  
- **Likes = instant verdicts.** Worth is outsourced to an algorithm.  
- **Followers = scoreboard.** Life becomes a zero-sum game of status.  

The result is not motivation but corrosion. Envy breeds bitterness, insecurity, and disconnection.

## The Gospel Alternative

Paul offers a radical reframe:  
> *“Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.”* (Romans 12:15)  

That is impossible in a scarcity system. But in God’s economy, abundance overflows. His love is not divided among His children — it is multiplied. Their blessing is not your loss. Their joy is not your theft.

## Application

The next time envy rises:  
1. **Name it** honestly before God.  
2. **Pray blessing** over the person you envy.  
3. **Celebrate one gift** you’ve received today.  

Each act of gratitude uproots comparison and plants joy.
