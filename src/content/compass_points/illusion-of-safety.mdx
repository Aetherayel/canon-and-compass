Modern life is built on safety promises: insurance, surveillance, security systems, endless backups. The message is clear: *“If you control enough, you will be safe.”*  

But control does not eliminate risk — it multiplies anxiety.

## How Culture Disciples Us Into Control

- **Technology:** every app promises mastery over chaos.  
- **Healthcare:** marketed as guarantee, not gift.  
- **Politics:** framed as protection from “them.”  
- **Parenting:** endless blogs on how to secure your child’s future.  

Safety is sold as salvation, and we become its worshippers.

## The Cost

Safety idolatry makes us brittle.  
We hoard, isolate, and worry. We strain relationships with micromanagement. We bow to routines and rituals that promise peace but never deliver.

## The Gospel Alternative

True safety is not the absence of risk but the presence of God.  

> *“The name of the Lord is a strong tower; the righteous man runs into it and is safe.”* (Proverbs 18:10)  

Surrender is not recklessness — it is rightly-placed trust. It frees us from living as our own saviors.

## Application

- Audit: Where do you over-buy, over-plan, or over-guard for safety?  
- Release: Leave one small thing unfinished this week as an act of protest.  
- Reframe: Name safety as God’s gift, not your achievement.

## Reflection

- Where do you cling most tightly to control?  
- How is safety becoming an idol for you?  
- What would surrender look like this week?
