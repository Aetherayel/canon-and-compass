Our age has no shortage of altars, but one of the most popular is the altar of productivity. Hustle culture promises blessing — influence, income, admiration — if you only sacrifice enough of your time and health.  

It’s a prosperity gospel without God.  
The rules are the same:  
- **Work harder.**  
- **Grind longer.**  
- **Prove your worth through visible results.**  

In return, the system promises identity. The “good life” comes if you just keep striving.  

But like all false gospels, hustle culture **overpromises and underdelivers**. The finish line keeps moving, the blessing is always deferred, and the cost is often your soul. Instead of rest, there is anxiety. Instead of joy, resentment. Instead of peace, exhaustion.

## A Different Kingdom

Jesus doesn’t sell blessing to the highest bidder. He announces it:  
> *“Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest”* (Matthew 11:28).  

Rest is not the absence of ambition — it is the re-anchoring of ambition in God’s finished work.  
Your worth is not in what you produce, but in who has already claimed you.

## Reflection

Where do you see hustle culture’s rules in your own life?  
- Do you measure days by tasks checked off?  
- Do you feel guilty for being still?  
- Do you believe peace only comes *after* performance?

## Response

Ask yourself: *What blessing am I chasing that Jesus has already given me?*  
Lay down one false rule today, and receive His gift instead.
