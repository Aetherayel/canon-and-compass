## Hustle Culture Is a Prosperity Gospel for Atheists

If you remove God but keep the hunger for blessing, you get hustle culture: salvation by output, heaven as status, hell as irrelevance. The liturgy is “rise and grind,” the sacrament is caffeine, and the Sabbath is a scandal.

**Stay rooted:** Rest is not retreat; it’s resistance. Sabbath says, _“I am not a machine.”_
