## Introduction

Every person operates from a **worldview**—whether they realize it or not. It's not just a set of beliefs, it's the *lens* through which you see everything.

We inherit our worldviews from culture, family, media, trauma, and tradition. But few ever stop to examine them.

This article will explore:

- What a worldview is
- How to evaluate one
- Why only the biblical worldview makes sense of reality

## What Is a Worldview?

A **worldview** is your core framework for understanding reality. It shapes your views on God, identity, meaning, morality, justice, and destiny.

> “A worldview is the story you believe about the world—and your place in it.”
> 

### A worldview is like:

- **Glasses** — filtering how you interpret life
- **A map** — guiding where you’re going
- **An operating system** — running in the background, determining what you accept as true

## The 5 Pillars of Every Worldview

Every coherent worldview must answer five unavoidable questions:

| Pillar | Guiding Question |
| --- | --- |
| **Origin** | Where did we come from? |
| **Meaning** | Why are we here? |
| **Morality** | How should we live? |
| **Truth** | How do we know what’s real and right? |
| **Destiny** | Where are we going? |

## Worldview Comparison Table

| Worldview | Origin | Meaning | Morality | Truth | Destiny |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Biblical Christianity** | Created by a personal, moral God | To glorify and enjoy God | Rooted in God’s character | Revealed in Scripture + reason | Resurrection & restoration |
| **Naturalism** | Random material processes | None—biological survival | Social constructs or instincts | Empirical only (science) | Annihilation (death is the end) |
| **Postmodernism** | Constructed by culture or language | Self-expression or critique | Relative to power structures | Subjective / “your truth” | Undefined or deconstructed |
| **New Age / Pantheism** | All is divine energy | Realize your inner divinity | Follow your inner self | Mystical experience | Reincarnation or cosmic absorption |
| **Moralistic Deism** | God exists but is distant | Be happy and good | “Be nice,” don’t hurt others | Personal intuition | Vague “heaven” for good people |
| **Islam** | Created by Allah | Submit to Allah’s will | Sharia-based moral code | Quran + Hadith | Paradise or hell |

## How to Test a Worldview

We use two criteria:

> ✅ Internal Coherence — Do its claims contradict each other?
> 
> 
> ✅ **External Correspondence** — Does it match real life, reason, and human experience?
> 

If a worldview fails either test, it can’t be true—no matter how sincere or popular.

## Why Other Worldviews Collapse

### Naturalism

> “We are only matter.”
> 
> 
> But matter can’t produce moral obligation or reliable reasoning. Naturalism borrows from a theistic framework to argue against God.
> 

### Postmodernism

> “Truth is relative.”
> 
> 
> But that’s an absolute truth claim. It collapses under its own logic.
> 

### New Age / Pantheism

> “You are divine.”
> 
> 
> Then why are we broken, guilty, and mortal? It denies evil while claiming we should live ethically.
> 

### Moralistic Deism

> “God wants us to be happy and nice.”
> 
> 
> But this God is functionally irrelevant—and offers no justice, rescue, or reason for our suffering.
>

## Why the Biblical Worldview Holds

The biblical worldview is the **only framework** that:

✅ Is logically consistent

✅ Matches what we observe about human dignity, evil, beauty, and purpose

✅ Grounds reason, morality, and meaning in something greater than opinion

| Pillar | Biblical Answer |
| --- | --- |
| **Origin** | We are created by God in His image |
| **Meaning** | Our purpose is to glorify and know Him |
| **Morality** | Goodness flows from God’s holy nature |
| **Truth** | Revealed in His Word and echoed in creation |
| **Destiny** | History ends in resurrection, judgment, and renewal |

The Bible doesn't just make truth claims—it makes **truth itself possible**.

It is the *source code* behind justice, logic, value, and hope.

## Reflection Questions

> Use these to examine your own worldview:
> 
- Which of the five worldview pillars have you never thought about?
- Can your current beliefs answer all five questions without contradiction?
- Do you believe truth exists—and if so, by what standard?
