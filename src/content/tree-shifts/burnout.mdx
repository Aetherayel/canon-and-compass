**Burnout** is more than tiredness—it’s exhaustion your soul didn’t ask for.
It often grows from an invisible system where your worth feels earned by output. You work hard, not because you hate rest—but because the rules you’re living by don’t make room for it.

## The Lie Vine
**Lie:** _“My value comes from what I do.”_

  > If I slow down, I’ll fall behind." <br>
  > "Rest is for people who deserve it." </br>
  > "If I don’t carry it, it drops.

If slowing down feels unsafe… you’re not lazy. You’re conditioned. This isn’t just something to fix—it’s something to understand.

You aren’t broken for liking the rhythms of our culture. You’re overconnected to a system that wasn’t made for humanity, much less you.

The Truth Tree doesn’t demand performance. It invites you into rest that reflects your true design.

Will you walk over?
