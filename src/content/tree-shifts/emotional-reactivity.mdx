It starts small: a reaction too quick, a word too sharp, a spiral too deep.
When emotions sit in the driver’s seat, life feels volatile. You’re left either excusing yourself — *“That’s just who I am”* — or drowning in guilt for letting feelings win again.

The system whispering beneath: **“You are your emotions. To deny them is to deny yourself.”**

## The Lie Vine

**Lie:** “My emotions define me.”  

> “If I feel it, it must be true.”  
> “I can’t help it, that’s just me.”  
> “Unless I express it fully, I’m not authentic.”

You are not less human for feeling deeply.  
But you are not free when feelings become your master.  
There is a better tree — one where emotions are honored, but not enthroned.
