# Bad Fruit: Anxiety

Anxiety is not simply “being stressed.” It’s the chronic hum of fear underneath life — the sense that if you don’t hold everything together, it will all collapse.  

It feels responsible, but it is rooted in the lie that **God cannot be trusted with the details of your life.**

## The Lie Vine

**Lie:** “I am only safe if I am in control.”  

> If I don’t plan for every outcome, disaster will strike.”  
> “God may love me, but He won’t protect me.”  
> “My worth is in solving problems before they happen.
