**Envy** is the ache of seeing someone else’s blessing as your curse. 
It’s not just wanting what another has — it’s resenting that they have it while you do not.  

Envy thrives in a system that whispers: *“There isn’t enough goodness to go around. If they win, you lose.”*

## The Lie Vine

**Lie:** “Their flourishing diminishes mine.”  

> “If they succeed, it means I’ve failed.”  
> “God must care about them more than me.”  
> “If I had what they had, I’d finally be happy.”

You don’t need to stay under this tree. Scarcity is not God’s economy. 

His blessing is abundant and specific, not zero-sum.
