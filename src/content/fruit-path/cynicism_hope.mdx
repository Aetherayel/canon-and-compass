# Bad Fruit: Cynicism


Cynicism feels wise. You’ve seen enough disappointment to expect it.
But what looks like discernment is often despair in disguise.

## Invitation


Cynicism promises protection but delivers emptiness.
There’s another root—one that grows hope instead of despair.

# The True Tree: **Hope-Based Identity**

**Cynicism told you hope is dangerous.**  
Hope in Christ tells you it is certain, because it rests not on circumstances but on His promises.  

<Scripture refText="Romans 5:5">
“Hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured into our hearts 
through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.”
</Scripture>

## New Fruit
| Old Fruit (what you’ve known) | New Fruit (what grows here) |
|---|---|
**Bitterness** — assuming the worst | **Joy** — receiving God’s gifts freely  
**Isolation** — pulling away in distrust | **Connection** — deep presence with others  
**Hopelessness** — nothing will change | **Resilience** — steady confidence in God’s faithfulness  
**Shallow connections** — never risking trust | **Peace** — resting in His promises  

---

## Next Steps

- **Name it:** Write down one place where you’ve stopped hoping.  
- **Pray it:** Hand it to God: *“Lord, I trust You with this hope.”*  
- **Practice it:** Choose encouragement over sarcasm once this week.
