**Burnout** is more than tiredness—it’s exhaustion your soul didn’t ask for.
It often grows from an invisible system where your worth feels earned by output. You work hard, not because you hate rest—but because the rules you’re living by don’t make room for it.

## The Lie Vine
**Lie:** _“My value comes from what I do.”_

  > If I slow down, I’ll fall behind." <br>
  > "Rest is for people who deserve it." </br>
  > "If I don’t carry it, it drops.

If slowing down feels unsafe… you’re not lazy. You’re conditioned. This isn’t just something to fix—it’s something to understand.

You aren’t broken for liking the rhythms of our culture. You’re overconnected to a system that wasn’t made for humanity, much less you.

The Truth Tree doesn’t demand performance. It invites you into rest that reflects your true design.

Will you walk over?

# The True Tree: **Grace-Based Identity**

**Burnout told you that worth is earned.**  
Grace tells you that worth is given.

<Scripture refText="Matthew 11:28–30">
  “Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 
  Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, 
  and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.”
</Scripture>

## New Fruit
| Old Fruit (what you’ve known) | New Fruit (what grows here) |
|---|---|
| **Burnout** — endless striving, exhaustion | **Peace** — knowing you are held even when you stop |
| **Anxiety** — fear of falling behind | **Trust** — believing God holds the timeline |
| **Shame** — “I should be more” | **Rest** — permission to be loved as you are |
| **Bitterness** — resenting others’ ease | **Joy** — delight in God’s gifts, without comparison |

---

## Next Steps

- **Breathe:** Try five deep breaths, each ending with the phrase: *“It is finished.”*  
- **Name a burden:** Write down one weight you’ve been carrying to prove yourself. Pray: *“Lord, this is Yours.”*  
- **Practice rest:** Choose one small act of Sabbath this week—not as a reward, but as worship.
