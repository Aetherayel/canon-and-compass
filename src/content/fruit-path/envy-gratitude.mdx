**Envy** is the ache of seeing someone else’s blessing as your curse. 
It’s not just wanting what another has — it’s resenting that they have it while you do not.  

Envy thrives in a system that whispers: *“There isn’t enough goodness to go around. If they win, you lose.”*

## The Lie Vine

**Lie:** “Their flourishing diminishes mine.”  

> “If they succeed, it means I’ve failed.”  
> “God must care about them more than me.”  
> “If I had what they had, I’d finally be happy.”

You don’t need to stay under this tree. Scarcity is not God’s economy. 

His blessing is abundant and specific, not zero-sum.

# The True Tree: **Gratitude-Based Identity**

**Envy shrinks your world to scarcity.**  
Gratitude reopens it to abundance.

<Scripture refText="Philippians 4:11–12">
“I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. 
  I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. 
  In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need.”
</Scripture>

    "trunk": "Trust in His provision",
    "branches": ["Celebration", "Contentment", "Generosity"],
    "fruit": ["Joy", "Peace", "Freedom in relationships"],
  }}
