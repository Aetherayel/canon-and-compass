# Bad Fruit: Anxiety

Anxiety is not simply “being stressed.” It’s the chronic hum of fear underneath life — the sense that if you don’t hold everything together, it will all collapse.  

It feels responsible, but it is rooted in the lie that **God cannot be trusted with the details of your life.**

## The Lie Vine

**Lie:** “I am only safe if I am in control.”  

> If I don’t plan for every outcome, disaster will strike.”  
> “God may love me, but He won’t protect me.”  
> “My worth is in solving problems before they happen.

# The True Tree: Trust-Based Identity

Anxiety thrives on control. Trust thrives on surrender.  
When your root is God’s faithfulness, not your vigilance, the fruit is peace.  

<Scripture refText="Philippians 4:6–7">
  “Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. 
  And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.”
</Scripture>
