# The True Tree: **Gratitude-Based Identity**

**Envy shrinks your world to scarcity.**  
Gratitude reopens it to abundance.

<Scripture refText="Philippians 4:11–12">
“I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. 
  I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. 
  In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need.”
</Scripture>

    "fruit": ["Joy", "Peace", "Freedom in relationships"],
  }}

| **Insecurity** — fearing lack | **Peace** — resting in provision |
| **Bitterness** — seeing blessing as unfair | **Freedom** — celebrating unique gifts |

## Next Steps

- **Name a win**: Speak out loud one way you’ve seen God provide in your life this week.  
- **Celebrate another**: Tell someone else you’re glad for their success.  
- **Practice generosity**: Give something small away today — not because you must, but because you can.
