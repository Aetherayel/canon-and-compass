# Bad Fruit: Control

Control feels responsible. You plan ahead, anticipate outcomes, protect against risk. But beneath this is a fear: *“If I let go, disaster will strike.”*  

At its root, control is not care but idolatry — the belief that safety is found in your vigilance, not God’s faithfulness.  

---

## The Lie Vine

**Lie:** “I am safe only if I am in control.”  

> If I don’t manage this, it will fall apart.”  
> “God helps those who help themselves.”  
> “My vigilance protects me more than His care.

## Invitation

Control promises safety but delivers slavery. There is another way — one where surrender becomes freedom.

# The True Tree: Surrender-Based Identity

Surrender is not giving up — it is handing over. It is living as though God’s sovereignty is real, not just recited.  

<Scripture refText="Proverbs 3:5–6">
  “Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. 
  In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths.”
</Scripture>
