type: "forest"
title: "Naturalism"
subtitle: "Where only what you can measure feels real, and mystery feels naive."
summary: "A felt description of Naturalism as a forest of clarity, control, and the seen."
series: "Naturalism"
climate: |
  In this forest, you trust what can be weighed, measured, repeated. The air feels clear when every effect has a cause and every cause can be named. Wonder is welcome as long as it stays inside the lab.

  What feels normal is keeping your feet on the ground and resisting claims you cannot test. What feels dangerous is the unseen: prayer, revelation, talk of souls. Faith, when it appears, feels like integrity - to follow the evidence and admit only what you can prove.
canopy:
  - transcendence becomes hard to see.
  - the soul becomes hard to see.
  - moral obligation becomes hard to see.
  - grace as a gift becomes hard to see.
quietGospel: "If it is real, it can be measured."
fruit:
  - skepticism that feels responsible
  - flatness that feels honest
  - prayerlessness that feels intellectually clean
  - hope reduced to probability
  - awe replaced by analysis
costStaying: |
  Over time, the world can feel smaller. You can explain so much, but you become less able to be surprised by goodness or to receive love as gift.

  You may gain control and lose awe. The part of you that longs to be known by Someone begins to go quiet.
costLeaving: |
  Leaving can feel like betraying reason, losing the identity that kept you safe. It can feel like stepping into naivete or being manipulated.

  It also means risking new language for meaning and grace, which is frightening when your community prizes certainty.
pathIntro: |
  The following reflections do not try to tear this forest down. They walk its edges, name its gaps, and point toward firmer ground.
orientation: |
  You do not have to leave this forest today.

  But you do not have to pretend it is the whole world either.
