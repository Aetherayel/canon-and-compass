title: "Moral Relativism"
subtitle: "Where right and wrong shift with the room, and certainty feels cruel."
summary: "A felt description of Moral Relativism as a forest of softness, safety, and shifting lines."
series: "Moral Relativism"
climate: |
  In this forest, you learn to read the room. Harmony feels like safety, so you keep your claims soft and your edges smooth. The emotional weather is polite but restless; you never want to be the one who names a line.

  What feels normal is keeping options open and letting everyone keep their truth. What feels dangerous is being called judgmental or cruel. Faith, when it appears, feels like empathy: to listen well, avoid harm, and stay open.
canopy:
  - moral reality becomes hard to see.
  - justice becomes hard to see.
  - repentance becomes hard to see.
  - courage to name wrong becomes hard to see.
quietGospel: "If you never name wrong, no one can name you wrong."
fruit:
  - silence that feels kind
  - avoidance that feels peaceful
  - conviction muted into vagueness
  - boundaries that feel unloving
  - exhausting self-editing
costStaying: |
  Over time, truth struggles to mature because it must stay negotiable. Relationships can remain warm but shallow, and real wounds do not get named.

  The conscience grows tired. You begin to sense that something real is being postponed, but you cannot say what it is.
costLeaving: |
  Leaving can feel like losing belonging, being labeled arrogant, or hurting people you care about. It asks you to stand somewhere and risk being wrong.

  It may feel like losing God, even when you are learning to see Him more clearly.
pathIntro: |
  The following reflections do not try to tear this forest down. They walk its edges, name its gaps, and point toward firmer ground.
orientation: |
  You do not have to leave this forest today.

  But you do not have to pretend it is the whole world either.
