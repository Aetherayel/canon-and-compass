If God is real, why is the world such a mess?

It’s the hardest question in theology.  
It’s also the most honest one.

Forget the debates about evolution, morality, miracles, and Scripture—**this** is where belief dies for most people.

Not in the lab.  
But in the hospital.  
At the funeral.  
In the trauma.  
In the silence after the prayer that wasn’t answered.

> “If God is good… why is this happening?”  
> “If God is just… where was He?”  
> “If God is real… why do I feel so alone?”

But what if the existence of evil isn’t proof that God is gone?  
What if it’s the **strongest clue** that He was _always there?_

### **Evil Doesn’t Disprove God—It Demands Him**

Let’s be honest—if moral relativism were true, there would be no _problem_ of evil.

There would just be:
- Unpleasant events
- Competing interests
- Unlucky lives

But when we say something is **evil**, we’re saying it’s not just inconvenient—it’s _wrong_. It _shouldn’t_ be. And that’s a massive claim.

You don’t get “shouldn’t” from atoms.  
You get it from **moral law**.

> Evil doesn’t make sense unless good is real.  
> And good doesn’t make sense unless there’s a standard beyond our opinions.

So ironically, to object to God _because_ of evil…  
you have to first assume something only God can explain.

### **Pain Breaks the Illusion of Moral Neutrality**

Most people can fake moral relativism—until suffering strips the pretense away.

Try saying “everything is relative” when:
- You’re betrayed by someone you loved
- You watch someone abuse a child
- You see injustice win while truth gets trampled
- You bury someone you prayed would be healed

Suddenly, you don’t want subjectivity.  
You want _justice_.  
You want _truth_.  
You want _a reason_.

Even your grief has theology in it.

Because deep down, you _know_ this isn’t how things are supposed to be.

And that knowledge is terrifying… but it’s also a signpost.

### **The Ache for Justice Isn’t a Cosmic Accident**

Imagine you’re standing in a ruined world:

- Violence everywhere
- Loss that doesn’t make sense
- Whole systems built on oppression
- People hurting others just because they can

Now ask yourself: _Why do I feel like this is wrong?_

Why should I expect justice, if the world was born in chaos?  
Why should I cry for meaning, if suffering is just nature being nature?

You’re not broken for feeling this.  
You’d be broken _not_ to.

Because the ache itself is evidence.

Not that God has abandoned us…  
but that we were **made** for something better.

### **Christianity Doesn’t Dodge the Darkness—It Enters It**

Here’s where Christianity parts ways with every other worldview:
- It doesn’t deny the evil.
- It doesn’t relativize the pain.
- It doesn’t call suffering an illusion.
- It doesn’t say you deserve it.

Instead, it says:

> “You’re right.  
> The world is broken.  
> It’s not how it should be.  
> But you are not alone.”

At the center of the Christian story is not a sermon.  
It’s a **cross**.

A man—beaten, betrayed, mocked, crucified.  
God Himself, willingly entering the full weight of human evil and absorbing it into Himself.

No other religion puts God on a torture device.

> Christianity doesn’t offer an escape from suffering.  
> It offers a **God who suffers with you—and for you.**

### **The Problem of Evil Is Real—But It’s Not the End**

If you’re angry, stay angry.  
If you’re grieving, don’t bury it.  
If you’ve been hurt, don’t let anyone tell you to move on.

But in your pain, don’t throw away the one story that _actually takes evil seriously._

Don’t give up on God because of suffering.  
He’s the only one who’s done anything about it.

The ache in your soul is not a reason to walk away.  
It’s a reason to _come closer_.

Because evil isn’t the end of the story.  
The empty tomb says: **even death doesn’t get the last word.**
