## Canon Note: Rest That Can’t Be Earned

You don’t earn oxygen; you breathe it. The same is true of rest in Christ. It isn’t payment for performance—it’s provision for presence.

> Try this: Take 5 deep breaths. With each exhale, quietly say: _“It is finished.”_

**Prayer:** _Lord, untangle my worth from my work. Teach me to abide._
