# The Roots of Performance

**Thesis:** Performance is a counterfeit tree grown from the meta-lie: _“You shall be as God.”_ It promises control, delivers scarcity, and disguises despair as discipline.

- **Anthropology:** Imago Dei vs. Self as project
- **Soteriology:** Grace as gift vs. worth as wage
- **Practice:** Abiding, Sabbath, communal limits

> In the Kingdom, we do not work _for_ identity; we work _from_ it.
