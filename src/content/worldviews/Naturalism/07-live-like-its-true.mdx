If the resurrection is true — not just spiritually, but historically — then Christianity is not a life hack, a coping mechanism, or a comforting metaphor.

It’s **reality**.

But now what?

This isn’t a movie that ends at the empty tomb.  
This is where _your_ story gets folded in.

And if you're just starting out — unsure, unpolished, even a little skeptical — that’s okay.

You don’t need hype.  
You need a structure that holds when you’re alone, uncertain, or raw.  
Not someone to fix you — someone to walk with you as you’re rebuilt.

So here’s the framework.  
It’s not everything. But it’s enough to start living like this is true.

### **Follow a Person — Not a Performance**

Christianity starts with _Jesus_ — not a rulebook, not a culture war, not a “type” of person.

Jesus didn’t say:

> “Memorize this doctrine and behave.”

He said:

> “Follow me.”

And when people did, it wasn’t about status or answers.  
It was about movement.

So start there:
- Not “how holy am I?”
- Not “how much do I know?”
- But: **Am I following Jesus today?**

You don’t have to be perfect to walk with Him.  
You just have to _move._

### **Read to Know the Voice**

This isn’t optional:  
If you want to know the real Jesus, **you need to read His words.**

Start with the Gospels — Matthew, Mark, Luke, John.

Don’t try to dissect everything.  
Just read slowly. Notice what He says. Watch what He does.  
Let Him define Himself.

Ask:
- What kind of person is this?
- Who does He seem drawn to?
- Who does He challenge?
- What surprises me?
- What stirs me?
- What offends me?

He’s not a slogan. He’s a _person._  
And knowing Him takes time.

### Pray Honestly, Not Impressively**

Prayer doesn’t need polish.  
There’s no formality requirement.

Just start where you are:
- “I don’t know what I’m doing.”
- “Help.”
- “What are You trying to say?”
- “Why does this still hurt?”
- “Thank You.”
- “I want to want You.”

Jesus didn’t teach His followers to impress God.  
He taught them to say:

> “Our Father…”

That’s where this relationship begins — not with perfection, but with permission to be _real._

### **Join a Community You Can Actually Walk With**

Don’t do this alone.  
You weren’t meant to.

Find a community — not just people who agree with you, but people who are learning to follow Jesus too.

Look for:
- Scripture and prayer at the center
- Humility, not showmanship
- Repentance, not performance
- Love that costs something
- People who listen, confess, forgive, and keep going

A real church isn’t a concert or a lecture hall.  
It’s a spiritual family — messy, but healing.

You need people who will challenge you, carry you, and remind you what’s true when you forget.

### **Embrace the Practice of Repentance**

You’re going to fail. You’re going to forget.  
You’re going to fall back into old habits, fears, and ways of thinking.

Don’t hide from that. Bring it into the light.

Repentance is not groveling.  
It’s realignment.  
It’s saying: _“That’s not who I am anymore.”_

It’s not about punishment. It’s about **freedom**.

Because following Jesus doesn’t mean never falling.  
It means knowing where to turn when you do.

### **Build a Rule of Life — A Spiritual Rhythm You Can Grow In**

Your life is already ruled by something: your schedule, your phone, your moods, your distractions.

So take charge of the structure. Put things in place that shape you.

Here’s a simple rhythm you can start with:
- **Daily:** Read Scripture. Pray honestly. Reflect quietly.
- **Weekly:** Gather with believers. Rest on purpose. Examine your heart.
- **Monthly:** Fast. Give. Serve. Confess.
- **Seasonally:** Reflect on what’s grown, and what’s still weak. Celebrate grace.

You don’t earn God’s love through this.  
You just build a structure that _makes space_ to receive it.

This is a long road. It’s not flashy.  
But it changes you.

You’re Not Done. You’re Just Beginning.**

If the tomb is empty…  
If Jesus really lives…  
Then your story isn’t over. It’s barely started.

You were made to know Him.  
Not just admire Him.  
Not just agree with Him.  
Not just believe _about_ Him.

**To walk with Him.**

And now that you’ve heard the call…  
You get to choose whether you’ll follow.

Not with hype. Not with pressure.  
With **clarity**, **honesty**, and **grace**.

You already have enough to begin.  
So take the next step.

Because He’s still saying:

> “Come, follow me.”
