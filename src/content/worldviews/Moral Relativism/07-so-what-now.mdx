If you’ve made it this far, maybe you’re not just curious anymore.

Maybe something’s happening.

Not just in your mind—but in your gut. In your heart.  
A sense that this isn’t just true. It’s _personal._

So here’s the question no worldview course, moral argument, or apologetics debate can answer for you:

> _What do I do with this?_

This isn’t about joining a church next Sunday or memorizing verses by next week.  
It’s about **what happens now**—_today_—in the quiet space where ideas become choices.

And you don’t need a perfect plan.  
You need a path.

### **Start With Surrender (Not a Spreadsheet)**

You might be tempted to immediately build a system:  
A reading list. A prayer tracker. A theology podcast marathon.

But Christianity doesn’t begin with productivity.  
It begins with **surrender**.

Not “clean up and come in.”  
Just _“Come.”_

You don’t need to fix your life.  
You just need to stop pretending you’re your own foundation.

The first and most honest prayer you can pray is this:

> “Jesus, if You are who You say You are… I’m Yours.”

That’s not weakness.  
That’s where life begins.

### **Let the Word Rewrite the Script**

If God has really spoken—through creation, through conscience, and finally through Christ—then you need to **hear His voice** directly.

That means opening the Bible.

Not as a project.  
As a conversation.

Start with **the Gospel of John**. Just one chapter a day.  
Let it confront you. Let it surprise you. Let it **read you**.

> Don’t ask: _“Do I agree with this?”_  
> Ask: _“What does this show me about Jesus—and how do I respond?”_

You won’t understand everything. That’s okay.  
You’re not studying for a test.  
You’re learning to follow a voice.

### **Build a Rhythm Before You Build a System**

What you need isn’t more information—it’s **formation**.

That means **rhythms**: daily, doable habits that keep you close to Jesus even when life gets loud.

Here’s a starting structure you can actually live with:

#### **Daily (10–15 minutes)**
- Read one chapter of Scripture (start with John)
- Pray honestly: thanks, confession, requests, silence
- Write down one thing that struck you

#### **Weekly**
- Take one day to unplug from digital chaos and just… be.  
    Walk. Think. Breathe.  
    Let your soul catch up.
    

#### **Monthly**
- Reach out to someone wiser in the faith.  
    Not to impress them. Just to ask:

    > “Can we talk about this? I’m not sure what I’m doing, but I know I need this.”


It doesn’t need to be complicated.  
It needs to be **consistent**.

### **Join the Story—Not Just the Argument**

Christianity isn’t a set of ideas you believe in your head.  
It’s a Person you follow with your whole life.

And that means stepping into a **story**.

If you believe Jesus is Lord, then you’re not just here to be right.  
You’re here to **be changed**.

So…
- Confess what needs to be confessed
- Forgive what you’re still holding onto
- Repent of what you’ve justified
- Serve someone who can’t repay you
- Love people who don’t deserve it

This is how you stop thinking _about_ Jesus and start _walking_ with Him.

### **You Don’t Need to Rush—But You Can’t Stay Here**

This isn’t the end of a journey.  
It’s the _very beginning_.

You don’t need to have all the answers.  
You just need to respond to the One who _is_ the answer.

So start small.  
Start honest.  
But **start now.**

Because Jesus is not an idea you add to your life.  
He _is_ your life.

> The world doesn’t need more good opinions.  
> It needs people who walk in the light—and don’t flinch.

**That can be you.**  
Not because you’re strong, but because He is.

Welcome to the way.
